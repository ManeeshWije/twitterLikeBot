# twitterLikeBot
- Python script which opens browser, logs into users twitter, searches up keyword, and likes all corresponding tweets
- You may have to download geckodriver and add it to your path or if on linux/unix, copy it to /usr/local/bin
- When using script, make sure to fill in username and password as well as keyword portion of the code!

NOTE:
- A better use of your time would probably to use tweepy instead of automation through Selenium as Twitter has updated their classnames to be dynamic. This was just a small project I made back in 2020 which still needs to be updated
